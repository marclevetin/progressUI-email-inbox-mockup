# ProgressUI Email Mockup
This project is a simple mockup of an Email inbox.  MVP requirements were:

1)  Use the ProgressUI framework
2)  Have an email search that filters the email by subject (or more)
3)  Explore a new https://www.json-generator.com/ just for kicks

## Solution
A quick solution bootstrapped with Create React App.  This project is not currently live.

## Installation

1)  Clone the repo and `cd` into the folder.
2)  `yarn install` will load all dependencies.
3)  `yarn start` will fire up a server.
4)  Navigate to `localhost:3000` if a browser didn't open automatically.
